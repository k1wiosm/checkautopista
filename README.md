For the new CheckAutopista2 see http://github.com/k1wiosm/checkautopista2

Quality Assurance tool for motorways in OSM. It allows to check any motorway in the world, as long as it's tagged as a relation with ```route=road```.

How it works: To obtain the data it uses Overpass API and it uses Leaflet to show them.

Quality Assurance
=================

You can choose a motorway and it checks the following information:

* name
* ref
* maxspeed
* lanes

On the exits it checks:

* ref
* destination
* exit_to
* name

Also it shows information about the tollbooths and the service and rest areas.

Languages
